# EXCEL-VBA-Report-Manager

This project is an integral component of an initiative undertaken for a water supply company. The primary objective was to assess the quality of its services and implement improvement measures based on data analysis.

In this section we will focus on step 2

# Previous work (step 0):

The preceding phase of the project involved selecting sensors capable of measuring water network pressures. This included choosing optimal placement points, ensuring smooth connectivity between the sensors and the company's private server, and meticulously calibrating the measurements

# Step 1:

# Step 2:

Before the implementation of the automatic sensors, measurements were taken manually and then the data was processed to prepare daily reports. This work took a whole day to make the 5 necessary reports.


The objective of this step was to reduce work and delivery times. The main challenge was to align the development of the reporting management system with the available technologies. Given that the department responsible for preparing the reports was restricted to using software provided by the company, the decision was made to utilize Excel and Visual Basic. The result is shown below:

This software enables the filtering of available data, spatially locating sensors, generating line graphs per sensor, and segmenting data for evaluating service quality. Ultimately, it facilitates the issuance of a PDF-format report intended for operational managers to make informed decisions based on the gathered data.
